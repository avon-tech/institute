Additional symptoms are brain fog, lack of motivation, and erectile dysfunction
Conventional medicine will diagnose low testosterone at 250-300
Normal testosterone levels in young males are 600-1000
If a male has testosterone of 400 the conventional doctor will say that is normal
Improving lifestyle, diet, and decreasing stress can increase testosterone to 600
High insulin can cause the deposition of belly fat
Too much estrogen can cause belly fat
Estrogen can drive sex hormone-binding globulin
Hypothyroidism can cause low testosterone and low sex drive
Lifestyle must be addressed before supplementing with testosterone
Sleep, stress, exercise, and diet must come first
Meditation is helpful
<!-- 14 ad -->
A case story of a recent patient who was already taking testosterone
I performed a Dutch hormone test, found the patient was an over aromatizer, and his SHBG was elevated
I prescribed anastrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor
I prescribed a peptide CJC-1297 [he meant CJC-1295] and ipamorelin (a peptide) to help lose fat
Diindolylmethane (made in the body from cruciferous vegetables) is a more natural way to prevent excess estrogen
Anastrozole was used instead of diindolylmethane to get faster results
Diindolylmethane is a compound derived from the digestion of indole-3-carbinol, found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli
Calcium glucarate can also be used to increase the metabolism of estrogen
Men can regain a huge amount of vitality with testosterone supplementation
Always monitor estrogen and sex hormone-binding globulin with people on testosterone

That means there is a hardening of the arteries in the penis
Viagra only addresses the end problem but ignores all underlying issues
Insulin resistance is connected to endothelial dysfunction 
When the endothelial cells aren't working then nitrous oxide is not going to have an impact
The first sign of heart disease is probably having trouble getting an erection

I take sugars, processed foods, gluten, dairy, alcohol, and soy out of the diet

1:53 75% of women suffer from PMS, and that is not a normal state of biology
2:41 When you go to a regular doctor and you have symptoms of PMS or heavy bleeding or menopause they will put you on birth control pills
3:10 We see stroke and blood clots with some women taking birth control pills, increase the risk for yeast infections, affects the microbiome
4:51 Perimenopause is 6 to 10 years before menopause
5:04 During this time hormones are not as regular and consistent
5:24 No ovulation that month results in less progesterone being produced in the body
5:42 You get high levels of estrogen and that can cause symptoms such as heavy bleeding, PMS, mood issues, sleep issues, and migraines
6:04 In those perimenopausal years women will have cycles where they don't have that progesterone spike so it feels like they are higher in estrogen 
6:28 The low progesterone makes us often feel crummy, more irritable, cranky, harder time sleeping, because progesterone is a calming hormone
<!-- missed word hot flashes? -->
<!-- 7:24 as an aside insulin, estrogen, adrenal, thyroid-->
8:53 When you're under a lot of stress your body will produce a lot of cortisol
9:37 If high stress then the body will spend all this time producing cortisol and then it can't do as good a job at producing progesterone
10:10 Self-care means I need to give myself time to rest, to sleep, to meditate, to exercise
10:32 Meditation 15 minutes twice a day can cut in half the amount of hot flash a woman has during perimenopause
11:02 Gaining belly weight increase aromatase enzymes which increase estrogen
11:23 Alcohol results in higher free estrogen 
11:31 Alcohol is a liver toxin that impedes the body's ability to metabolize estrogen
11:58 There's a linear relationship between alcohol and breast cancer risk 
12:29 Studies show even one drink a day is linked with an increased risk of breast cancer
12:44 Alcohol depletes B vitamins
14:40 The women who have the worst problems have the worst diet, stress, drink too much, don't exercise, lots of stress, don't meditate 
<!-- 13:39-14:35 ad marks picks -->
<!-- dutch test? flax seeds? -->
15:18 Foods in the broccoli family help estrogen metabolism
15:33 Sulforaphane found in cruciferous vegetables helps reverse estrogen‐induced metabolic changes <!-- per own research -->
15:56 Soy foods have phytoestrogens, reduce estrogen, whole unprocessed soy foods are healthy
<!-- 17:47 Flax seeds good -->
18:00 Every meal should have healthy fat, fiber, and protein, this will prevent spikes in blood sugar and insulin
18:52 We can prescribe progesterone to help with sleep, but lifestyle comes first
19:20 Dr. Bohams case study, a woman age 45 in perimenopause, we checked hormones at day 20 in her cycle, progesterone was low
19:50 We supported her progesterone production with good self-care
20:00 We lowered her estrogen levels with the cruciferous vegetables
<!-- MTHFR so folate-rich foods? -->
20:09 We added supplements [diindolylmethane] that were helpful 
20:21 We had the patient stop caffeine consumption
20:41 Women suffer unnecessarily with PMS sleep issues, mood issues, depression, migraines, abnormal pap tests, dysfunctional uterine bleeding in which they have clots and painful periods 
<!-- 21:33 Our way is the thyroid approach, adrenal treatments, and the insulin approach, fixing the estrogen metabolism and the toxins -->
22:17 Dr. Hyman's case study, a patient with an abnormal Pap test
<!-- checked her she had these weird genes that made it hard for her to metabolize estrogen -->
23:08 I gave her indole-3-carbinol, a substance found in vegetables such as broccoli
22:34 3,000 micrograms of methyl folate are helpful to reverse cervical dysplasia (abnormal cells in the narrow neck of a woman's uterus)
<!-- consume folate-rich foods which are foliage or green leafy veggies -->
25:14 PMS is easy to fix with this approach

Clostridia bacteria in the gut can unwrap estrogen and reabsorb it

Oral estrogens are more pro-inflammatory because they go through the liver
<!-- Topical estrogen would be safer -->
Giving extra estrogen is not without risk
<!-- want to lower estrogen to reduce cancer -->
<!-- generic forms hard to get the data -->
Estrogen I typically don't give orally because of increased risk of inflammation and blood clots 
I usually give estrogen transdermally
The main reasons we're using estrogen is for hot flashes, sometimes sleep, and bone density
We'll use vaginal estrogen for vaginal dryness, it has a low rate of systemic absorption 
I'll use progesterone orally if a woman is struggling with sleep
One can use it through the skin which can be used both to regulate periods if somebody's still in perimenopause and for anxiety and sleep
If a woman still has her uterus it's necessary if you are going to give estrogen that you give progesterone along with it 
I've seen progesterone work incredibly for pre-menstrual migraines, sleep issues, anxiety, heavy periods, cramping, heavy bleeding
Testosterone can help us use less estrogen
Testosterone helps libido and vaginal dryness
<!-- I give a transdermal hormone therapy of an estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone combination -->
Give the patient diindolylmethane, also known as DIM [from cruciferous vegetables], and lignans from flax seeds
I prefer topical hormones
I am comfortable giving a patient long-term vaginal estrogen and a little topical clitoral testosterone

, $$When labs show low B12 despite adequate intake that is probably because the person is not absorbing it well.
You can absorb 3 mcg B12 at one time, that is one ounce of liver.
Passive absorption is weaker than active absorption
The intestines reset every few hours at which time a person can get another dose
Do not eat liver at every meal, can overdose copper and vitamin A
Serum B12 15% up or down compared to last labs is normal
The most infamous B12 absorption issue is pernicious anemia (When the body can't make enough red blood cells because it lacks B-12)
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune attack on cells in the stomach that make intrinsic factor, which is a protein needed to absorb B12
The rate of pernicious anemia in society is 0.1%, but after age 60 then it is 1.9%
15%-40% of older adults have lower absorption from subclinical gastritis
H Pylori can cause this, 50% have this, even if no symptoms
Do not lay down after taking medications, can harm the stomach
The RDA for adults is 2.4 μg/day of vitamin B12
Take 40 mcg/day dose if impaired absorption, but passive absorption intact
600 mcg/day should cover the needs for most but not all with pernicious anemia
1000 mcg/day if covering the needs of all with PA
1000 to 3000 mcg is probably not harmful
Better to not take a higher dose if not needed
High doses of micronutrients that are not needed are possibly not good for the microbiome
Lab level of B12 400 is the minimum we should have
Measure methylmalonic acid to verify B12 status
If one has no absorption problem then beef liver capsules are ok
B12 injections not needed, oral B12 is effective, even for pernicious anemia
If vegan I am not confident the B12 in nori, seaweed, or mushroom is adequate, must test to monitor
If serum has high B12 and supplementing B12 then that is ok
If serum has high B12 and not supplementing then check blood liver and kidney health
I do not recommend the cyanocobalamin form of B12

1:05 First, there is a long slow phase where the blood glucose rises very slowly and the insulin resistance is rising 
1:16 During this time the body produces enough insulin to overcome this resistance so the blood glucose stays relatively normal
1:22 This is called compensatory hyperinsulinemia
1:30 Eventually, the pancreas doesn't produce sufficient insulin, the blood glucose goes up, and type 2 diabetes is diagnosed
1:40 The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is late in the game

, $$7:43 Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide
7:58 3% of adult males and 12% adult females in the US are iron deficient
8:25 Females are more vulnerable because of monthly menstrual blood loss
8:56 Stages in the development of iron deficiency anemia:
&emsp; &emsp; 1. Negative iron balance (less iron is coming in than is leaving)
&emsp; &emsp; 2. Fall in iron stores (serum ferritin falls to < 12-15 ng/mL)
&emsp; &emsp; 3. Only then is there a fall in serum iron and transferrin saturation to < 15%
&emsp; &emsp; 4. The appearance of hypochromic (less color than normal) reticulocytes (immature red blood cells)
&emsp; &emsp; 5. Hemoglobin falls (Hemoglobin is a protein in the red blood cells that carry oxygen)
&emsp; &emsp; 6. MCV falls (MCV is the average size of the red blood cells)
9:47 Reasons for inadequate absorption include:
&emsp; &emsp; Poor bioavailability
&emsp; &emsp; Antacids or high gastric pH
&emsp; &emsp; Dietary bran, phytates, competition from other metals
&emsp; &emsp; Loss of absorptive enterocytes (cells of the intestinal lining)
&emsp; &emsp; Celiac disease
&emsp; &emsp; Inflammatory bowel disease
11:41 Iron deficiency is often a sign of underlying pathology
11:51 Iron deficiency in a postmenopausal woman or adult male is due to GI blood loss until proven otherwise
12:19 That means it is colon cancer until ruled out.  To not know this is malpractice.
12:30 Iron deficiency is not the same as anemia
12:50 Iron deficiency is associated with fatigue in non-anemic individuals
13:02 There was a trial of women with fatigue, not anemic, ferritin < 50, hemoglobin average 12.4.  They were given IV iron.
&emsp; &emsp; There was no benefit
&emsp; &emsp; But those women with ferritin 15 or less then there was a significant benefit
14:49 Fatigue can be caused by low iron, even in the absence of anemia
15:17 Patient history may include:
&emsp; &emsp; Restless legs
&emsp; &emsp; Wounds slow to heal
&emsp; &emsp; Pagophagia (compulsive ice chewing) and forms of pica (chewing substances such as ice, clay, soil, or paper)
&emsp; &emsp; Painful tongue
&emsp; &emsp; Brittle hair and hair loss
&emsp; &emsp; Cracking at corners of the mouth
&emsp; &emsp; Spooning nails
16:08 Workup:
&emsp; &emsp; Serum iron
&emsp; &emsp; Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC is a functional test for transferrin)  Do not order transferrin.
&emsp; &emsp; Ferritin
&emsp; &emsp; Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) Rises dramatically with iron deficiency
16:55 Transferrin is the major iron transport protein
<!-- Transferrin is minimally affected by acute inflammation, but with time the serum transferrin... -->
17:36 Transferrin saturation is the serum iron divided by the TIBC
17:46 Transferrin saturation can change because of inflammation
17:53 Functional iron deficiency occurs when the percent transferrin saturation falls to 15-20%, even if the patient has iron stores
18:07 Can be confusing to the physician if a patient has both inflation and iron deficiency
18:14 By itself, transferrin saturation is not diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia because it takes a constellation of lab findings
18:28 Ferritin is produced mostly by liver cells, functions as an iron storage protein, and has no transport function
19:10 A patient with iron overload due to hemochromatosis can be treated with therapeutic phlebotomies
20:00 If ferritin < 12-15 ng/mL that is iron deficiency, which may not be anemia
20:15 If ferritin 15 - 200 ng/mL that is possible iron deficiency depending on clinical circumstances
20:48 Serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, that might not reflect iron stores, so look at all data and clinical history
21:19 Treatment of iron deficiency assumes the cause is known
21:38 Oral iron supplements will often suffice
21:42 Parenteral iron required if:
&emsp; &emsp; Patient not compliant
&emsp; &emsp; GI side effects (seen in 15-20% of patients)
&emsp; &emsp; Patient cannot absorb oral iron
&emsp; &emsp; Rapid reversal is required
&emsp; &emsp; Ongoing losses exceed absorptive capacity
23:15 Meat is the only food that can provide significant iron
23:55 Iron in meat is heme iron, which is more efficiently absorbed
24:18 Oral replacement guidelines:
&emsp; &emsp; Try to give 100mg of elemental iron daily
&emsp; &emsp; Take in between meals on an empty stomach
&emsp; &emsp; Less expensive forms generally work as well as more expensive forms
&emsp; &emsp; Newer forms such as Proferrin have absorptive advantages but are more expensive
28:02 Iron is absorbed mostly at the first part of the small intestines <!-- so rectal suppository I assume won't work -->
30:14 Iron absorption can be tested with an oral iron absorption test
&emsp; &emsp; Give two tablets of iron on an empty stomach or with orange/lemon juice
&emsp; &emsp; Measure serum iron at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes
&emsp; &emsp; Serum iron should increase by at least 100 mcg/dL
31:30 A 32-year-old female patient had chronic fatigue and mild anemia, no GI symptoms
&emsp; &emsp; An oral iron absorption test showed she could not absorb iron
&emsp; &emsp; Based on that finding alone she underwent an upper endoscopy and small bowel biopsy which confirmed celiac disease
32:37 There are five forms of FDA approved parental iron
34:01 Safety profiles are good for the newer IV iron but none are 100% risk-free
39:32 Goals of Treatment
&emsp; &emsp; Correct the anemia
&emsp; &emsp; Provide enough iron to raise iron stores (monitored by serum ferritin)
&emsp; &emsp; Follow the serum ferritin to assess the iron balance
&emsp; &emsp; Give enough additional iron to prevent recurrent iron deficiency
<!--When the patient is told their hemoglobin is normal but continue oral iron 3-4 months the patient often does not comply-->

, $$Immunoglobulin A (IgA) promotes health by regulating the composition of gut microbiota
The first common pattern is insufficiency dysbiosis which is a lack of beneficial microbes
90% of the beneficial bacteria are Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
The second common pattern is inflammatory dysbiosis
Balance in the microbiome does not mean the complete elimination of all harmful microbes
Balance means there are enough beneficial microbes to keep the harmful microbes in check
A small number of harmful microbes can have some beneficial functions
Certain pathogens should be completely gone, but the opportunists are not a problem at low levels
Bacteroides species prevent the colonization of harmful microbes by producing the short-chain fatty acid propionate
Primary causes of dysbiosis:
&emsp; &emsp; Pathogens
&emsp; &emsp; Drugs (antibiotics, PPIs, etc)
&emsp; &emsp; Poor diet
&emsp; &emsp; Digestive & immune dysfunction
&emsp; &emsp; Toxins
Giardia generally is a harmful microbe, but just because a particular microbe is present, doesn't necessarily mean it is causing a problem.
<!-- 42:00 he says klebsiella is detected but I don't see it -->
<!-- Giardia often produce all patterns, digestive problem -->
Elastase-1 range states >200 ug/g, the patient value of 302 is not flagged as low but is below optimal of 500
Steatocrit is a measure of fat malabsorption
Giardia is known to cause intestinal permeability, so it will be seen with high anti-gliadin IgA
Zonulin high can be seen with Giardia
Common pattern #3 is digestive dysfunction dysbiosis
This is caused by low stomach acid, insufficient bile acids, poor digestion (pancreatic insufficiency or brush border enzyme deficiency), reduced absorption, and altered GI motility.
Pathogens can be caused by low stomach acid
H pylori causes hypochlorhydria in most people that have it
Digestive dysfunction can cause overfeeding of good bacteria so they will be overgrown
Enterococcus and Streptococcus can overgrow if stomach acid is low
In the section Phyla Microbiota, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes can be overgrown which is caused by excess food components that are not digested and absorbed properly.  
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes overgrowth can also be associated with SIBO.
Prevotella copri tends to benefit from undigested carbohydrates
Can't overemphasize how important optimizing digestion is
Prebiotics can help promote balance in the microbiome
Inulin can help promote the butyrate-producing bacteria
Glucomannan can help promote Bacteroidetes
If these beneficial bacteria are low then consider using prebiotics
Probiotics are helpful
Saccharomyces Boulardii has a lot of research behind it for balancing the microbiome
Colostrum has a lot of research beyond it for low Secretory IgA, promoting intestinal barrier and balancing the microbiome
SBI Immunoglobins is a nondairy version of immunoglobins
Glutamine and zinc carnosine can help mucosal gut health and reduce leaky gut
Polyphenols have been shown in several studies to balance the microbiome
Polyphenols inhibit pathogenic bacteria and stimulate beneficial bacteria
Nutritional deficiencies such as zinc can affect the production of stomach acid and other processes
Vitamin A and D deficiency are well known to have effects at the mucosal barrier
To increase Firmicutes which are the butyrate producers increase prebiotics such as resistant starch and inulin
For Bacteroidetes they can do well on starches or glucomannan, increase protein in the diet, improve mucous of the gut lining
Anti-inflammatory diet and supplements
Polyphenols are helpful
If a significant imbalance in the microbiome then antimicrobials might be needed
Candida is inflammatory
Th17 cells are inflammatory

Note when Giardia is not flagged as high but is present
<!-- he mentions guide sheets to download -->
Clostridium and Bacteroides are often elevated when digestion is not optimal, especially when stomach acid is not sufficient

In the Normal Bacteria section of the GIMAP, we want those microbes to be in the stated range

An overgrowth of normal bacteria tells us there is digestive insufficiency
I start by looking at the Phyla Microbiota section because 85-90% of our bacteria fall into one of these two phyla
Three factors can cause overgrowth
&emsp; &emsp; Hypochlorhydria (Low stomach acid)
&emsp; &emsp; Low Pancreatic Output
&emsp; &emsp; Migrating Motor Complex Disruption
Stomach acid stimulates pancreatic and biliary bicarb secretion

Stomach acid is essential
<!-- Low stomach acid... -->
Low pancreatic output is commonly caused by
&emsp; &emsp; Hypochlorhydria, I often treat patients with HCL
&emsp; &emsp; Vegetarian Diet
&emsp; &emsp; Suppressed pancreatic function
&emsp; &emsp; Gallstones
<!-- if elastase < 200 -->
The migrating motor complex (MMC) propels undigested food residue through the intestines
The migrating motor complex is interrupted by the ingestion of food
Fast for 3 hours between meals to allow the MMC the ability to complete

Case study of a patient that started to feel tired, could not think, put in the hospital for catatonia, could not speak, the brain scan was ok
Doctors noticed the patient had slightly high calcium
The most common cause of high calcium is parathyroid disease which can cause all of these symptoms
The patients parathyroid level was low so that was not the problem
The patient was taking vitamin D 5k per day, serum vitamin D level was in the 80s
The patient stopped taking vitamin D and all symptoms resolved
The ideal range of vitamin D should be 30 to mid-50s
Vitamin D is a hormone
Vitamin D serum 80-120 is harmful
Excessive vitamin D supplementation can take years to cause harm
Serum 12-30 may be too low
The serum range of 30 to 50 is good
Vitamin D < 50 I never see problems
Vitamin D > 70 I do see problems
<!--Vitamin D 25 might be ok-->
Low vitamin D is associated with many diseases, but correlation is not causation
Low vitamin D causes bone disease, but chronic disease might cause low vitamin D
Parathyroid glands keep calcium in a proper range
General fatigue and malaise are the main symptoms because of calcium's effect on nerves
High parathyroid is usually because of a tumor
High serum calcium means calcium is leaving the bones which can cause osteoporosis
If an adult then calcium should be in the 9s
The conventional lab range of calcium is too wide
If calcium is over 10 and over age 40 then could be a problem
If calcium is higher then parathyroid should be lower, they are opposite
If calcium is higher and parathyroid high normal that could be a problem
<!--Vitamin D controlled trials we do not see big benefits but might play a role with infections-->
It is not clear that a person with normal vitamin D will benefit from supplements
If deficient might benefit from supplements
1k to 2k might help if low

I do not recommend cod liver oil, vitamin A is too high
A friend died at age 70 of heart failure, wrote public letters that he died of excessive vitamin A
There is a risk of skin cancer from sun
Clothing will block sun generating vitamin D
If a person is larger then vitamin D requirements increase
The form D3 is preferred
There are benefits from the sun other than getting vitamin D
2000 IU is a baseline amount for all adults
If larger BMI or darker skin then need a higher amount
If a person lives in higher latitude or is not outside at midday or has skin covered with clothes then the person will insufficient vitamin D
Take vitamin D with food
30-40% of the population has autoimmune gastritis so they can't absorb nutrients well from supplements.  In that case, a liquid form is better.
D without K can increase calcification and raise the risk for cardiovascular harm, this is shown in many papers
<!-- promotes daily reset pack -->
if calcium is plant-derived and a form that is well absorbed then one does not need a lot of calcium, because none wasted in calcification
calcium di malate is the better form

If liquid vitamin D then I prefer larger drops per ounce, and I prefer 1000 IU per drop. Do not add to other drinks.
If BMI 25-30 then add a drop, if BMI 31+ then 2 drops
If higher latitude add a drop
If darker skin add 1-2 drops

13:12 Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, muscle pain, hair loss, weight gain, and dry skin.
13:36 Magnesium deficiency can cause fatigue.  My favorite form is di-magnesium malate.
14:12 Urinary tract infections (UTI) can cause fatigue.  Do a urine culture because sometimes the in-office test alone is not adequate.

Most have no symptoms so underdiagnosed
Some studies show 20% of the population have this condition
If thyroid disease then 30-40% of the population have this
Symptoms can be in the upper GI tract, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, things are stuck going down
Symptoms can be in the lower GI tract, abdominal pain or discomfort, gas, bloating, diarrhea constipation, stool leakage, or incontinence
Gastritis that is not autoimmune can be caused by H Pylori
<!-- symptoms are heartburn, low nutrients, ulcers... his statements become unclear, the online article is also unclear -->
One of the first things that happen is iron starts to decrease
Test for parietal cell antibodies and intrinsic factor antibodies
We can see stomach damage by testing gastrin
If stomach damage then order an upper endoscopy to sample stomach
Test full iron panel and B12 
If overt anemia or B12 anemia or high gastrin then endoscopy with biopsy
Virtual biopsy or serum biopsy is available only in Europe
For the first 1-2 decades there will be antibodies, but no symptoms, no damage to the stomach, ferritin is decreasing for those decades, no elevated gastrin
In the later stages, B12 will be low

Serum calcium is not related to the nutritional status of calcium
Calcitonin is a perk of natural desiccated thyroid
The correct serum level of calcium is essential for health
If serum calcium is high then test parathyroid hormone.
If calcium is normal or high and if the parathyroid hormone is high then the patient might have parathyroid disease
High serum calcium is always significant and should not be ignored, even if just a little high, even if one time.
High serum calcium could be kidney disease or cancer.
The preceding information is primary hyperparathyroidism
<!-- Secondary hyperparathyroidism could mean kidney failure or calcium or vitamin D deficiency -->
A little less than 1% of the population has primary hyperparathyroidism
The cause of hyperparathyroidism is not known
Symptoms are kidney stones, gallstones, bone pain, bone fractures, feeling tired, do not feel well, GI symptoms, IBS heartburn, ulcers, constipation, frequent urination and thirst, anxiety, brain fog, difficulty concentrating
If calcium is 9.8 or above then test parathyroid hormone
If calcium 9.9 and parathyroid is elevated this could still be parathyroid disease
If on the high side of calcium then should be on the low side of parathyroid hormone
If both calcium and parathyroid are high then something is wrong, review with the parathyroid surgeon

, $$Autoimmune diseases can not be cured
The word "cure" means the disease does not exist
A better goal is remission, or that the disease is not expressed as much
Autoimmune diseases are not caused by a nutrient deficiency, so taking more supplements is not going to cure it
The following are the things that prevent autoimmune disease patients from getting better:
Reason #10 is not taking diet restrictions seriously, inflammatory foods are often wheat, gluten, dairy, grains, nightshades, lectins which are foods with seeds
If a person does not have access to food testing then they should just follow an autoimmune paleo diet
It is best to start with a 100% full autoimmune paleo diet, and then back off to see which foods cause sensitivities
Reason #9 is restricting diet too much because we need diverse fiber for a diverse microbiome
<!-- LPS A reduces inflammation -->
<!-- cant just eat psyllium husk all day -->
Reason #8 is chemical exposures which are a major trigger for autoimmune disease, mercury fillings, BPA, fire retardants, plastics, pesticides, flooring releases gases, better to use glass or metal <!-- Cyrex array 11 --> <!-- improve biotransformation pathways -->
Reason #7 are silent infections such as H Pylori or Epstein Barr virus <!-- EBV affects lupus -->
Low white blood cell count could be a clue there is a silent antigen
<!-- Reflux could be a clue there is a silent antigen -->
Reason #6 reason is a lack of sleep which is necessary for immune system regulation
Reason #5 is a lack of proper circadian rhythms, cortisol and melatonin should be at opposite levels
One should be on the same schedule every day
Reason #4 is lack of movement and a sedentary lifestyle
The more intense the exercise is the greater opioid response there is 
If you're going to exercise with a high intensity you can't cross over to the threshold where you crash
Reason #3 is not having enough opioids by being happy, having goals, having good social relationships
Stay away from negative people
Reason #2 having unhealthy relationships at home or work; this is a game-changer
Reason #1 is being a passive patient, not making effort, not asking questions, not digging deeper, not trying different things, trial and error to see what makes one feel better or worse
Not taking enough supplements is not on my list of reasons
The two most common infections that are triggers for autoimmune diseases are h pylori and hepatitis c
If you don't know where to start I suggest you look into the autoimmune paleo diet
Q If I get merely a mild reaction to a food, may I eat it once in a while?  A No, it will aggravate your immune response
Q can a person with Hashimoto's ever eat gluten dairy eggs?  A Mostly likely no, have a long-term mindset. Not likely for gluten dairy and nightshades.
Q What does one eat for breakfast?  A Eat like a caveman which is vegetables, fruit, and meat
<!-- if TPO TG up or down [a little] it does not matter, look if they are... -->
Q Why does my energy crash at 2 pm?  Reactive hypoglycemia is not a disease. One needs enough fiber and protein, don't miss meals, not a sweet meal, not fruit for a meal.  Blood sugar fluctuations are triggers an autoimmune system
<!-- if adapted in fasting that is different -->
<!-- Q may I eat a vegan diet?  A specific diet protein is the issue... -->
Q can a pressure cooker reduce lectins?  A yes heat can reduce lectins and glycoproteins
<!-- food sens is not autoimmunity, autoimmunity means antibodies to own tissue proteins -->
The gold standard for food testing is ELISA such as from <a href='https://app.avonehr.com/catalog' target='_blank'>Cyrex Labs</a>
I do not like Wheat Zoomer tests or Vibrant food tests
Food tests need sensitivity specificity reproducibility which Cyrex does have
Do not use blood spot tests for food tests
It is very clear in science that 95-98% of thyroid disease is autoimmune
<!-- if high TSH then it is autoimmune -->
If one eats too many carbs then over time cells lose insulin sensitivity, if low carb diet then cells regain sensitivity
<!-- leaky gut plays a role in AI disease, will publish studies -->
It is normal to have a small number of antibodies, different labs give different ranges and results, use the range of that lab.  There is no functional range for antibodies.
Leaky gut is measured by zonulin and occludin antibodies at <a href='https://app.avonehr.com/catalog' target='_blank'>Cyrex Labs</a>
<!-- IGG IGGE -->
Q how about quinoa buckwheat?  A depends on severe the reactions are.  Most autoimmune patients do better on grain-free diets, but some can get away with consuming them
<!-- not enough fats... -->
<!-- If one has a gallbladder issue then fat... -->
<!-- Q reactive functional hypoglycemia is diagnosed by symptoms and glucose under 85... -->

Some people have a leaky gut but they don't have reactions to foods because they digest their food well
<!-- To digest food one needs to make enough hydrochloric acid and pancreatic enzymes -->
A leaky gut with an inability to produce digestive enzymes is different than a leaky gut with proper digestion
Endotoxemia is a condition in which bacteria produce endotoxins and then those endotoxins get into the bloodstream
Bacteria in periodontal diseases can lead to chronic inflammation in the body and cardiovascular risk 
Adverse bacteria produce lipopolysaccharides and they're called endotoxins
When endotoxins get into systemic circulation that is endotoxemia which is the worst scenario of leaky gut
<!-- good foods are broccoli acai blueberries -->
When people have leaky gut and endotoxemia their leaky gut causes massive inflammation throughout their body <!-- ** -->
The best test for leaky gut is <a href='https://app.avonehr.com/catalog' target='_blank'>Cyrex Labs</a> Array #2
If the polysaccharide levels are high in blood then that person not only has leaky gut but they have leaky gut with endotoxemia
Leaky gut with endotoxemia will cause severe inflammation throughout the body and they're at risk for many conditions
If one has leaky gut with endotoxemia then one may suffer from chronic unresponsive depression unresponsive to anti-depressants
There are many studies linking endotoxemia to dementia and Alzheimer's disease
Endotoxemia is much more serious than just leaky gut and when you see those LPS levels high in the blood that it's a whole different scenario
When lipopolysaccharides get into the bloodstream they have been found to disrupt insulin receptor signaling
Studies have shown that endotoxemia is directly linked to obesity 
Hypothyroidism may make you more prone to having dysbiosis
The main cause of leaky gut is an inflammatory diet
The main cause of dysbiosis is a bad diet or a gallbladder issue and not releasing bile salts
<!-- Just taking a probiotic and glutamine will not help leaky gut -->
If those underlying mechanisms are not treated a probiotic by itself or taking nutraceutical support like gut support is not going to work
If I see that they have zonulin antibodies elevated and they have LPS levels elevated it becomes an immediate clinical priority
<!-- 31:55 **how to cure leaky gut and endotoxemia -->
<!-- 33 the cure is taking his online classes or Kharazian institute -->
<!-- 35 the cure is to address the underlying mechanisms -->
<!-- 35 glutamine alone will not cure it -->
Bone broth is great it has lots of healthy glutamine and factors that help the gut intestines heal
Some people can get a large benefit from bone broth, but other people have underlying mechanisms causing their digestion to break down and still has endotoxemia and they consume bone broth and it has no effect
If a person has candida albicans antibodies in a blood test that is much more serious.  If present stop all sugar.
Testing for zonulin antibodies is better than stool or serum zonulin, it is more stable.
If stool zonulin is positive then the person has a leaky gut, if negative then it may be a false negative.
<!-- glutamine is not excitatory.  glutamate is excitatory.  glutamine does not convert to glutamate. -->
A root canal can produce gram-negative bacteria, and if oral barrier permeability, then a bad root canal could cause endotoxemia
The only way to measure endotoxemia is through a blood test.  You can measure lipopolysaccharides in the stool test but that doesn't mean you have endotoxemia.
Fasting, or 12 to 14 hours of intermittent fasting, can reduce endotoxemia because it helps dysbiosis. <!-- **** -->
<!-- parasites might be good for you, might reverse autoimmunity, glycoproteins, helminths, new drugs coming -->
The easiest and one of the most effective forms of fasting is 18-hour fasting with six hours of eating, this gives lots of health benefits <!-- **** -->
When fasting with water take electrolytes and sodium and salt so you don't have electrolyte imbalance issues
If HDL is over 80 with symptoms then suspect inflammation
1-3 drinks of alcohol will not cause leaky gut if the person is healthy
Coffee has health benefits <!-- due to flavinoids -->
<!-- 52 ad -->
Brain injury can cause leaky gut
<!-- Food sensitivities might improve if one improves tolerance -->
<!-- water carbonation, I don't know -->

In the functional medicine world, people use terms like "adrenal exhaustion" or "adrenal fatigue" but these are just slang terms
The key is does a person have enough adaptive properties to deal with their stress load
Elevated cortisol also has been shown to cause intestinal permeability which is known as leaky gut
Physical stress, emotional stress, or lifestyle stress that exceeds what their body can adapt to can result in decreased cortisol
A low cortisol pattern can result in blood sugar drops
If you don't get enough sleep your resilience to stress immediately goes down
You have to have some movement and exercise
Social support and social communities are helpful to deal with stress
Cortisol levels should be high in the morning and they should start to taper down as the day goes on
One can measure a person's cortisol in the morning, noon, afternoon, and nighttime.
Disruption of the cortisol rhythm can result in energy differences throughout the day
They may not be able to get out of bed or may have energy crashes right in the afternoon 
If the cortisol levels aren't able to go back down at night time they may not be able to fall asleep
The cortisol awakening response is how quickly cortisol levels go up within the first 30 to 45 minutes when you open your eyes
Cortisol levels should go up in the first 30 to 45 minutes by about 50 percent
Cortisol issues can be: too much cortisol, not enough cortisol, abnormal cortisol rhythm, or abnormal cortisol awakening response
Patients should get better sleep, exercise, meditate, social support, get rid of news or internet use that creates anxiety
Adaptogens such as ashwagandha and rhodiola etc can help
<!-- vitamin c, hydration -->
The most accurate way to know if your adrenal glands are dysfunctioning from a cortisol perspective is to run an adrenal salary test
<!-- if nervous in social settings then adaptogens will not help -->
Hypoglycemia can indicate low cortisol
If one has hypoglycemia then eat frequently to not let blood sugar levels drop
<!-- shaky lightheaded and irritable which means your cortisol start levels are probably low -->
Salt can help low cortisol
If one is gaining weight that could be high cortisol <!-- so decrease carbohydrate -->
If sodium and potassium are low then suspect low cortisol
A general physician or general practitioner will not know what a journal salivary cortisol test is because it's not a test for a disease, it's a test for function
An endocrinologist is focused only on endocrine diseases like Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease which are life-threatening
<!-- preventive medicine, lifestyle medicine, functional medicine -->
The adrenal salivary test is valid, hundreds of studies say it is valid
The adrenal salivary test has an option for a cortisol awakening response
It is better to be specific: is it a cortisol rhythm issue, a cortisol level issue, or a cortisol awakening response issue
<!-- "HPA axis dysregulation" -->
<!-- High evening cortisol might be from exercising too late, eating too late, eating wrong foods, blood sugar issue -->
<!-- dysautonomia is a brain issue, might need neurofeedback, neurocognitive therapy, brain injury, early MS, not easy to treat, not adrenal fatigue.  diagnose by changes... -->
Huperzine for the brain
<!-- an ad for save your brain course and book -->
<!-- could be a brain issue -->
<!-- catecholamines -->
Recent research shows salt increases autoimmunity, but if low cortisol and crave salt then take salt even if autoimmune disease
    because if aldosterone issue one cant retain that sodium
If one has an adrenal issue and low cortisol and low sodium, then test 21 hydroxylase antibodies
<!-- Ginkgo biloba will increase your nitric oxide levels or just take vinpocetine -->
<!-- melatonin improves sleep, low cortisol also improves melatonin -->
<!-- Taking melatonin can throw off the persons natural melatonin rhythm -->
<!-- adrenal stress index -->
<!-- autonomic blood pressure -->
<!-- the accepted way is to do an adrenal salivary index test to look at course levels throughout the day as the most reliable and evidence-based way -->
<!-- re dutch test, the gold standard is salivary so use that -->
<!-- orange juice too much sugar -->
<!-- to fix adrenal issues then fix brain, hypoglycemia, infection, not direct adrenal treatment -->
<!-- lab should be CLIA certified -->
A common thing of people with adrenal issues is they're hypoglycemic, they keep missing meals until they stop missing meals all day and having tea and honey as a meal or smoothie as a meal they don't have a chance to fix their adrenals
Another common cause of high cortisol is people have insulin resistance, they don't get enough physical exercise, they eat way too many carbs and sugar

5 So then the question becomes why are we eating more and that's when we turn to the brain 
7 The food that we eat has become more and more seductive as we've been able to concentrate the ingredients that the brain wants like sugar and salt and fat and starch and combine those through industrial processing into increasingly seductive combinations that give us too much eating drive
11 We have increasingly concentrated the active ingredients in foods that release dopamine in our brain
13 If you look at hunter-gatherer diets, the way our ancestors would have lived for thousands and millions of years, their diets were really simple, they were just eating plain cooked tubers, plain fruit, plain meats, plain nuts
<!-- 16 The foods we are hardwired to respond to with a dopamine response are the things that kept our ancestors alive in ancient and difficult environments... calories... -->
17 There is an evolutionary mismatch 
22 You get more fat loss benefit from the diet side than from the exercise side
22 Adding exercise on top of diet does generally increase the amount of weight loss
35 When one loses weight the body slows its metabolic rate
40 One thing that can affect the level of bodyweight that it's defending is the seductiveness of the food that we're eating is if we eat simple unrefined foods the brain seems to be more comfortable at a lower level of body fatness than if we're eating very seductive highly palatable combinations of salt sugar fat etc
40 Another thing that seems to make the brain more comfortable at a lower level of body fatness is a higher protein intake
40 Some people find that physical activity helps their brains be comfortable at a lower level of body fatness so regular physical activity seems to help lower that defended level
41 Sensory specific satiety means that we have different fullness bins in our brain for different types of foods, so we can feel full on savory foods but we're not full on sweet foods
43 People tend to overeat spectacularly at buffets, you can essentially be eating a different food with every single bite, so you're creating very little sensory-specific satiety
<!-- 45 you've come to associate the taste of the kale with the fat and salt that is intrinsically rewarding to your brain -->
46 You can train yourself to be attracted to less palatable foods if you don't eat them, so salty and sugar things can appear too sweet or too salty after a while 
47 The longer the brain has not experienced that cookie the more that response fades so that brain forgets that reward association over time
48 When a person quits smoking they have strong cravings right afterward however after a couple of months it gets easier and then after a year or two years suddenly they don't even have cravings anymore at all and they're repulsed by the smell of cigarettes
48 If you have not eaten ice cream or you haven't had a coca-cola for a long time you might still enjoy it if you did again but it doesn't have the same power over your brain in the same way as it does if you're having it regularly
50 In a study whole unrefined foods were more satiating per calorie than all the refined processed foods
51 If you don't sleep enough studies consistently show that you will eat more calories

, $$1 In the scientific literature people have been using the word "intestinal permeability" for decades, the slang term is "leaky gut"
<!-- I have 20 years of experience -->
<!-- https://www.facebook.com/datiskharrazianpage/videos/291327158602108 --> <!-- facebook video has better video quality -->
3 Intestinal permeability does not necessarily cause gastrointestinal symptoms
3 The only indication one has intestinal permeability clinically is chronic pain, chronic inflammation, chronic swelling
3 Intestinal permeability in the scientific literature is associated with things like chronic depression
<!-- 6 In the year 2000 where a researcher named Dr. Alessio Fasanoat the University of Maryland identified the protein that opened up tight junctions -->
<!-- a drug is in phase three trials -->
<!-- there are two types of leaky gut -->
11 The worst scenario researchers found is when patients develop endotoxemia
13 Researchers have found endotoxemia associated with everything from systemic inflammation to autoimmunity to depression to cardiovascular disease to renal pathology to various cancers to rheumatoid disease to insulin resistance to metabolic syndrome
14 There are key questions you always have:
&emsp; &emsp; Is the leaky gut paracellular or transcellular
&emsp; &emsp; Is there endotoxemia?  We measure that by lipopolysaccharide antibodies in the blood
&emsp; &emsp; Do they have intestinal permeability in combination with blood-brain barrier permeability
&emsp; &emsp; Has a person developed autoimmunity?
16 The lab tests I use are zonulin, occludin, and actomyosin antibodies.  Those markers will let us know if it's transcellular or paracellular permeability
17 To measure if endotoxemia has taken place we measure LPS antibodies
18 Being hormone-deficient whether it's thyroid hormones or progesterone or estrogen can impact and promote intestinal permeability
19 As the person's body mass increases they are more prone to have a leaky gut because body fat has cells called adipocytes which create inflammatory proteins
20 An autoimmune paleo diet that gets rid of inflammatory foods like gluten and dairy is an effective strategy to help
20 Nutraceuticals like vitamin D, glutamine, short-chain fatty acids, bone broth to heal the gut have some papers behind it
20 Zinc carnosine is somewhat beneficial 
22 Leaky gut is not a nutritional deficiency
23 Supplements like glutamine, butyrate, marshmellow are a little anti-inflammatory and can help but they do not address the cause
24 Supplements might resolve if leaky gut was caused by an antibiotic
24 Extreme stress from overtraining could cause leaky gut
25 One can not just take supplements and eat paleo to cure leaky gut, must find the root cause
26 When people have multiple food sensitivities that means the person has had a loss of oral tolerance, which means their immune system is having an overactive response to dietary food proteins
<!-- 27 3d immune tolerance protocol -->
28 Fixing leaky gut might not change persons food sensitivities, because there are other mechanisms, such as celiac disease
29 People can have sensitivity to nightshades, foods with seeds, might not improve after fixing leaky gut
31 It is a myth that autoimmune disease will be cured by fixing leaky gut
31 Proper language is remission not cure
<!-- 32 Fixing leaky gut might reduce symptoms -->
<!-- Cyrex array #2 leaky gut -->
<!-- 36 The Zoomer test is not valid, they use microarray analysis, only ELISA is the gold standard.  Companies use microarray analysis because it is cheap. -->
<!-- mentions SIBO breath test -->
<!-- 38 LPS is measured by... -->
<!-- 40 take all types of short-chain fatty acids but just butyrate is ok.  or just eat fiber food or supplements -->
<!-- if a patient test shows transcellular leaky gut then look for celiac, intestinal autoimmune disease, infection -->
<!-- fasting can heal every tissue in the body, it turns on genes to heal, tissue regeneration --> <!-- **** -->
<!-- mast cell activation can cause... calm it down -->
<!-- I am writing a book on leaky gut -->
<!-- cant fast until blood sugar hypoglycemia is handled, if addicted to sugar then cant fast, fruit, first cut off sugar, first keto -->
<!-- soil-based probiotics is just another nutraceutical, deficiency is not the cause, claims exaggerated -->
<!-- SIFO is just yeast overgrowth in the gut, only happens if first inflamed, etc, caused by something else, will be sens to sugar -->
<!-- I don't know the word SIFO because I don't read on the internet, I spend my time in the peer-reviewed literature -->
<!-- elevated ferritin acute phase reactant, inflammation -->
<!-- berberine definitely helps blood sugar problems, so many trials that now we have meta-analysis, very clear helps insulin resistance -->

, $$0 Blood sugar is one of the most common things I see overlooked by other healthcare professionals
0 If you eat a meal and there's a change in your energy whether you feel better and you can function again or you eat a meal and you get tired that indicates you may have some blood sugar instability issues
0 There should be no change in energy levels after eating
1 If you get shaky, light-headed, irritable and you can't think and you can't focus and that's when you decide to eat then you've got a blood sugar problem [hypoglycemia]
2 It is critical to make sure patients blood sugar issues are stabilized and managed
4 People have glucose levels in the early pre-diabetic stage which we call the insulin resistance stage but they are not fully diabetic yet
5 Many people with blood sugar issues have normal lab tests
6 A patient that does not have a healthy blood sugar handling system may wake up in the morning feeling tired 
<!-- hypoglycemics breakfast is honey in tea, muffin, fruit smoothie -->
<!-- hypoglycemics often have low blood pres, poor circulation, cold hands feet -->
<!-- infertility should start with blood sugar -->
<!-- need more protein fat fiber, too much sugar or sugar as a snack by itself, no missed meals -->
19 A good snack is an avocado with olive oil and salt
19 High fiber means vegetables, not fruit
<!-- how often should one eat?  as often as it takes to not have the symptoms -->
<!-- hypoglycemics often don't eat enough -->
21 If you're hypoglycemic and you constantly wake up in the middle of the night then you're not getting enough caloric intake to build glycogen
<!-- hypoglycemics take b vitamins -->
<!-- BCAA help get blood sugar up bandaid -->
<!-- fiber pectin guar gum helps -->
<!-- adaptogens help -->
23 The insulin-resistant person feels tired, craves sugar and stimulants right after eating a meal <!-- is this me**** -->
24 Insulin resistance is the stage before diabetes
<!-- 24 if they have a daily aspect of getting candy and eating candy like you can expect them to be insulin resistant -->
<!-- orange juice acai bowl honey pasta cause insulin surge, too much sugar carbs, need to decrease -->
<!-- more veg and meat -->
<!-- how much to eat?  the amount that does not make you pass out -->
<!-- limit carbs, more fat fiber -->
26 Artificial sweeteners have been shown to disrupt the hypothalamic signaling pathways
26 No artificial sweeteners or stevia if a person has insulin resistance
27 People with insulin resistance must get physical activity or exercise
29 Walking 10 minutes will not lower blood sugar levels, research clearly shows the more intense your exercise the better blood sugar control you have
29 Berberine is the most effective nutraceutical to support blood sugar imbalances, has several meta-analyses
31 Most have both hypoglycemia and insulin resistance, then follow both guidelines, cut off sugar for a while
31 Crash means can't think, can't focus, no energy
32 There are dramatic benefits of fasting, but if the person has blood sugar issues then cant fast, first need to rebuild for 6-12 months <!-- **** -->
33 If person cant get blood sugar stable, then need to consider high fat keto diet for several months, can take breaks, helps adrenal glands recover <!-- **** -->
35 Blood sugar disorders are a major cause for chronic debilitating anxiety and mood disorders and depression
39 People can have both hypoglycemia and insulin resistance
40 Insulin resistance can cause gall bladder problems
41 If you have the symptoms of low blood sugar but blood levels ok then it is functional hypoglycemia not pathological
42 Fiber is the top supplement for blood sugar issues, psyllium husk, guar gum, pectin <!-- **** -->
43 Taking fiber supplement with each meal is one of the most important things you can do <!-- **** -->
44 Do not take the fiber first thing in the morning, take the fiber with each meal <!-- **** -->
44 The single most important nutraceutical to help with all those blood sugar pathways is fiber
47 Fasting glucose is the worst test
47 Glycomark is a good test to see glucose spikes
47 Postprandial testing is the best test, one and two-hour glucose and insulin
48 A1C and fructosamine measures glucose glycation
<!-- skipped hormone stuff... -->
53 Keto diet is for both hypoglycemics and insulin resistance, lets your adrenal glands your pancreas your liver take a break, do for months with breaks <!-- **** -->
54 Ketosis can resolve sugar cravings <!-- **** -->
<!-- 55 reactive hypoglycemia is... -->
55 One can have both hypoglycemia and insulin resistance
56 Hypoglycemics have to eat frequently enough so you don't get shaky lightheaded and irritable 
57 Only branch chain amino acids help with blood sugar, not all amino acids, but this is the least effective way to get anything done
58 A hypoglycemic diet lifestyle is eating fruit all day and skipping meals
<!-- 59 adrenal antibodies... -->
60 Hashimoto's is not a reason to not be on a keto diet
61 A person with hypoglycemia insulin surges disrupting their immune function might not resolve until they go on ketosis <!-- **** -->
61 Top supplements for hypoglycemia are adaptogens, B vitamins, fiber, plant sterols, BCAA <!-- **** -->
62 Top supplements for insulin resistance are berberine, resveratrol, SCFA, fiber, EPA, DHA, alpha-lipoic acid
62 Metabolic syndrome is the same as insulin resistance but more progressed, it is on the way to diabetes

, $$The number one rule is to start at the top of the GI tract (the mouth) and work your way down
If one just thinks about eating something sweet then one will release insulin
Hydrochloric acid (HCL) is important, if deficient then you feel like there is a brick in your stomach, will feel averse to eating protein
If bloating after eating meat that indicates HCL deficient
If starch makes one bloated then pancreatic acids or HCL helps
If fat makes one bloated then gall bladder issues, sludge will be found in an ultrasound before stones
Lots of women have gallbladder issues, so they avoid fat
Leaky gut can come from a pro-inflammatory diet, high in sugar, high in carbs, not enough vegetables, olive oil, fish, fish oils, antioxidants
Fermented foods have a tremendous health impact on gut
As we get older then we lose some parietal cells, less HCL
The most common reason for less HCL is H Pylori
Taking enzymes will not deregulate one's own enzyme production
The best way to test one's HCL production is the Heidelberg test, that's the gold standard
<!-- people complained that they could read the brain book because of their brain issues, so then I created the save your brain online program    [so I don't need the online program] -->
If taking HCL causes burning then the person has a pre ulcer or ulcer, which can be caused by H pylori
The apple cider vinegar (ACV) test is to take some tablespoons of ACV and see what happens
Apple cider vinegar is not as strong as HCL
If your bloating reduces with apple cider vinegar then you probably should take HCL
Take the amount of HCL that makes your digestion ideal
H pylori is the most common infection in the world, many people will have it two times, many are asymptomatic, it shuts down HCL, causes ulcers
H pylori can cause lots of health problems, 1000 papers, cardiovascular disease
H pylori can cause gastric cancer
If one has no gallbladder then take bile salts, betaine, HCL, lipase, which one might need to take indefinitely
if you have an autoimmune disease then follow the paleo autoimmune diet forever
The paleo autoimmune diet will not reverse autoimmune disease but it can stop flare-ups
<!-- shrimp protein? -->
gallbladder ultrasound to check for stones
<!-- I use the Genova stool analysis test -->
<!-- yes take apple cider vinegar, it has health benefits -->
Some people take enzymes just to optimize digestion <!-- seems to be positive on this -->
The most common food reactions are gluten, casein, albumin, corn, soy, nightshades, lectins, nuts, seeds

, $$If a person has bloating ask if this occurs after certain foods or portion sizes
If after protein then might need HCL (supplemental hydrochloric acid)
If after starch/fiber/salads then pancreatic enzymes  <!-- [pancreas produces enzymes important to digestion, insulin, etc] -->
If after fat then gallbladder <!-- [the gallbladder is a small hollow organ where bile is stored ] -->
If after everything then SIBO
<!-- If after larger? portion size then dysautonomia or gut dysfunction --> <!-- [dysautonomia means the autonomic nervous system does not work properly] -->
As people get older they produce less HCL
Degeneration or H pylori can cause less HCL
HCL causes pancreatic enzymes to be released
If one cant digest fats then try HCL
HCL neutralizes bad bacteria <!-- for the microbiome -->
Low HCL can cause bad breath from protein putrification
Low HCL can cause reflux
Consider apple cider vinegar which is not as strong as HCL
Try taking 1,2,3 HCL capsules to get rid of bloating
If burning sensation then test for ulcers, H pylori causes ulcer
Mucous on stool can be caused by lack of pancreatic enzymes but that comes from HCL deficiency
Gallbladder sludge can be seen on ultrasound <!-- , can't digest fats, burping, fish oil cant handle, 2 hours later, referral pain -->
Gallbladder issues can cause upper back tightness, stool floats
It is gallbladder sludge, not gallstones, that are missed in conventional medicine
If gallbladder issues then need to thin bile, go off fats, take bile salts
<!-- beetroot extract, milk thistle....  lipase? -->
<!-- SIBO -->
For SIBO try a low FODMAP diet for a few weeks
SIBO could be caused by the valve not working well, could be chronic inflammation in the gut, degenerates nerves, permanent
SIBO could be from a brain injury so treat the brain to improve digestion
Bloating can be caused by food sensitivities such as gluten dairy albumin etc
Bloating can be caused by intestinal autoimmunity in the gut
If a person can't swallow, begs not to take capsules, only wants powder, that means brain-gut axis intestinal mobility not working
If bad diet then the microbiome will be unhealthy, need fiber
The least effective for bloating is probiotics
Q if take HCL then will I make less HCL?  I think no
<!-- when I travel to new culture then I take HCL -->
If one takes HCL and there is burning then that's ulcer or gut thinning
To heal the stomach lining take DGL (deglycyrrhizinated licorice), this has good research backing it up 
Test H Pylori on patients can cause gut inflammation, cancer, and blood vessel disease
See if apple cider vinegar helps digestion, 2 tbsp to 1/4 cup, the next level is to take HCL
Q best time to take HCL or enzymes?  A try different times
SIBO breath test is accurate, low fodmap diet as a test can diagnose this
The gold standard for food testing is ELISA, worst is ALCAT
Q Is the baking soda test accurate for HCL deficiency?  Answer: There are no studies
Heidelberg test is the gold standard test for HCL deficiency, very accurate
<!-- Q celery juice, answer not clear -->
Dysautonomia is complex, I take 3.5 hours neurological exam to find which part of the brain causing this
<!-- dysautonomia bandage HCL probiotics butyrate -->
Candida is yeast overgrowth, too much sugar, starch, and fruit, take antifungals
One can take a butyrate supplement or consume fiber will convert into butyrate
Butyrate is a fuel source to help gut cells grow and many other health benefits

A fat transfer breast implant might be ok
<!-- untreated thyroid disease can cause psychosis, I have treated this, but is rare -->
<!--titanium is better?-->
An implant is only a problem if the implant breaks down, titanium does not
I am not concerned about a titanium replacement hip
<!-- but it is not pure titanium -->
Surgical grade titanium best
<!-- hyperthyroidism is 1% of cases -->
<!-- surgery can trigger autoimmune disease if... -->
<!-- psoriasis - have not identified the target protein, so cant be diagnosed -->
Ceramic and titanium are better for implants, resistant to breakdown, very hard, breast implants are soft, can easily break down

3 If protein not digesting then that's a lack of HCL
3 If carb or starch not digesting then that's a lack of pancreatic enzymes
3 If fat is not digesting then that's a gallbladder issue
<!-- ad for gut health class -->
<!-- if not enough HCL then the body makes too much HCL and the patient needs HCL -->
<!-- if proteins do not digest then can putrify -->
6 Burning or reflux can indicate a lack of HCL
6 Acidity is needed to absorb minerals
8 Lack of acidity can result in infections like H pylori
9 Lack of acidity can cause serious health problems
<!-- can cause food sensitivities -->
10 If you have a reflux test then try 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar <!-- mentions class -->
11 If symptoms get worse then the person has an ulcer, heal the ulcer first, check for H Pylori
12 DGL shown in numerous studies to heal ulcers
14 The main reason for lack of acid is older age, around age 50
15 If younger then the lack of acid could be H pylori, hypothyroidism, brain issues, food sensitivities
16 Reflux is a big deal, causes calcium deficiency, harms the microbiome
<!-- the main topic now is gallbladder -->
17 Gallbladder issues are more common in females over age 40
18 Gallbladder sludge are identified on abdominal ultrasounds, can lead to gallstones
19 Conventional medicine doesn't do much about this gallbladder sludge
20 The risk factors for bile turning into sludge
21 The main symptoms are maldigestion when you eat fatty foods, severe bloating burping
22 Gallbladder sludge is a serious matter, one can become deficient in vitamin A, D, K, E, and essential fatty acids
25 The biggest driver of gallbladder issues is sedentary and high insulin
25 A sign of high insulin is being tired after meals especially if high in carbs
26 If gallbladder issue then go off fat and take neutraceuticals
27 Drink coffee to thin bile, beetroot...
<!-- 30 taurine phosphatidylcholine green tea -->
<!-- 31 HCL triggers gallbladder, think north to south -->
<!-- 33 my protocol -->
<!-- 34 if cant get bile thin enough then take bile salts -->
34 If you cant take ACV or HCL then that is a sign of thinned gastric lining, so take DGL glutamine, etc, should work in 30 days
35 If that does not resolve the issue then test H pylori
36 If gallbladder issues then give it a break for 30, 60, 90 days by not consuming fat
37 The best test for H pylori is urea breath test <!-- can also do stool --> <!-- do not get serum antibodies -->
40 DGL does not raise blood pressure, licorice raises blood pressure, DGL can be used indefinitely
<!-- 42 ad for a class -->
44 Digestive enzymes can be taken long term
50 If one keeps getting h pylori then could be getting it from other family members
52 Coffee enema effective for gallbladder sludge because of its caffeine, drinking coffee also works
<!-- 56 ad for a class -->
57 If low HCL then the body will surge HCL suddenly, this means they need an HCL supplement, not antacid
58 The best test for HCL is the Heidelberg test <!-- they use the same capsule with everyone [this is concerning] -->
<!-- you will know you are taking too much HCL [I do not agree] -->
<!-- ad for a class -->
61 The HCL supplement may be taken at any time [I do not agree]

<!-- kids now can't eat nuts -->
<!-- allergies are IgE, its fast, that what classical doc is concerned with, the skin test is unreliable -->
<!-- sensitivities are IgG IgM IgA, is delayed, is inflammatory -->
<!-- antigen is a foreign thing ie pathogen, food protein -->
<!-- antigenicity is how aggressive the antigen is -->
The most common foods with high antigenicity are gluten, milk, albumin, egg, casein, and lectins for autoimmune populations
There are no food sensitivities to anything other than proteins
The immune system reacts to one part of the protein, not the entire protein
The lab test says "wheat" but its really to just one part of wheat
Antigenicity changes if a food is heated, so lab tests must test raw or cooked foods, conventional labs test only raw foods
Only <a href='https://app.avonehr.com/catalog' target='_blank'>Cyrex Labs</a> tests raw and cooked
When foods combine the reaction can change, such as pepperoni pizza, donuts
There is an explosion in gluten sensitivity worldwide
Wheat has been hybridized and modern wheat is more antigenic
Chemicals such as fire retardants bind to albumin and increase reactivity
<!-- mentions Stephanie Seniff -->
Pesticides bind to food and can't be washed off
Food coloring binds to food protein, cant be broken down
<!-- leaky gut -->
<!-- autoimmune patients have leaky gut -->
<!-- microbiome dictates the response -->
<!-- SigA cells calm immune response, stress, mold -->
There is cross-reactivity because the amino acid sequences similar
Q Why do foods come up on food sensitivity labs that I never ate? A cross-reactivity to similar foods
All protein powders have issues, even collagen, processing changes protein and makes it more antigenic <!-- **** note even collagen -->
I recommend no protein powders to my patients, they are antigenic, just eat whole foods
Do not consume food dye
<!-- If SigA high, infection in the gut, reaction to gluten, etc -->
Q How does one get calcium from the diet?  A eat vegetables, they are high in calcium, you don't need milk
If you have not eaten gluten in years you might get a false negative on a sensitivity test, but cross-reactivity still gives a reaction
<!-- sibo can cause food sens -->
Candida is secondary to something else, what is the cause of the candida
The gold standard of food sensitivity is to eliminate foods for three weeks
<!-- mast cells -->
<!-- first food added can give a big reaction -->
SIBO has a high relapse rate
<!-- DAO breaks down histamine, IgE, quercitin effective -->
Q how to tighten up intestinal junctions?  A diet infection hormones etc.  Not just paleo and glutamine etc.  High blood sugar can cause a leaky gut. <!-- **** -->
Q Viome?  A has a long way to go, not there yet
<!-- Q if lab test sens to gluten etc but I did not eat it  A error or trace amounts  [but he answered differently earlier] -->
<!-- AIP paleo but vegetarian will be hard to get proteins -->
GMO is a change to protein structure, some people will be sensitive, neoantigen
Patients will most often report sensitivities to soy, corn, wheat, milk, egg, lectins, nightshades
<!-- whole population GMO study can show no effect but subgroup did, so need group analysis -->
<!-- muscle testing discussion -->
GAPS diet for healing gut for most people will not be that simple
Q How eat a diverse diet when I can only eat 3 foods?  Answer: Just eat more vegetables anyways (but not lectins and nightshades)

26 You can take them by mouth, or have a compounding pharmacies mix them and apply vaginally, help the good bacteria climb up the urethra and into the bladder

, $$1 About 50% of men and women have dealt with hair or will deal with hair loss at some point in their life
3 If hair loss occurs in patches then it is probably an autoimmune process
4 The more common situation that people have is a more diffuse hair loss or either a male or female pattern hair loss
<!-- 5 Look at the patient's diet, how is their digestive system working, how are they digesting and absorbing -->
<!-- 6 If autoimmune then look at microbiome, intestinal permeability, autoimmune triggers -->
7 Look at hormones, thyroid, digestion, nutritional status, iron deficiency, gluten, inflammatory foods, low protein intake especially if vegan
8 A common reason that women have hair loss that's hormonally related is when they develop polycystic ovarian syndrome or PCOS and insulin resistance and they start to have higher levels of testosterone and DHEA
9 They're growing hair in places that they don't want 
10 This it's driven by insulin resistance and high insulin
10 Some toxins are associated with insulin resistance like BPA, certain pesticides, changes in the microbiome have been associated with insulin resistance
10 A very common reason in this country for insulin resistance is the poor diet
11 This also messes up their period, fertility
12 Decrease sugar and starch
13 Oral glucose and insulin tolerance test
14 One of the most common signs of an underactive thyroid is shifts in your hair, thinning, dryness, loss of the outer third of the eyebrow
15 We're seeing a pandemic honestly yeah of thyroid issues in this country
15 Thyroid can cause thinning of the hair, hair loss, cracked nails, dry nails, brittle nails, dry skin, constipation, fluid retention, muscle cramps, fatigue, morning tiredness, low sex drive, high cholesterol, depression, cognitive function
17 When people have deficiencies in selenium iodine vitamin A then thyroid hormones conversion is affected
17 Must check thyroid antibodies
<!-- if older age then higher thyroid range? -->
<!-- TSH 3 is not optimum -->
20 Gluten is associated with hair loss, because of not optimal digestion and absorption of food
21 If you're not eating enough protein or if you're not digesting and absorbing it well enough
<!-- 21 We check for amino acids ****maybe I should do this test -->
22 When we give them amino acids and you give them between meals I see huge benefits for their hair
22 When biotin is low a lot of times people will see that their hair is breaking or they also notice their nails are breaking
23 Get a full iron panel for ferritin and iron saturation  
<!-- there is no one perfect iron test -->
23 Ferritin 50-70
26 A case story of a patient with hair loss, she was vegan
27 We tested serum amino acids, she was low on all, her ferritin was 6
<!-- vegans & Iron zinc omega-3s, protein -->
29 If vegan then might have to supplement with amino acids
<!-- 30 vitamin c with iron -->
<!-- amino acids between meals -->
<!-- huge improvements -->
31 Case study #2
31 Her waist-hip ratio was a little bit high it was at 0.85, and we want for women their waist tip ratio to be less than 0.8
32 Her fasting insulin was 15, should be less than 5
32 We did do a glucose tolerance test, her one and two-hour insulin went up to 150-200 <!-- this is why weight... -->
33 We pulled away some whole-food carbohydrates that aren't necessarily bad foods but they were bad for her right now
33 When you have insulin that's so high you don't tolerate a lot of the carbohydrates even if they're healthy carbohydrates like brown rice, buckwheat, and quinoa
34 We tested BPA from plastics
35 Toxins can cause diabetes
36 Teabags that stand up have microplastics
36 BPA free is not good, use glass or steel

6:35 More common are intolerances and sensitivities to foods which are not allergies
9:42 We test for IgG and IgA food antibodies but the elimination diet is the best way to determine food sensitivities
10:39 Gluten is commonly causing this type of innate immune response
11:28 Our diets lack diversity
12:03 Eggs are a good food and very high in nutrient density but they have a higher allergenic potential
12:16 If you're eating multiple eggs every day eventually with enough exposure the body interprets these proteins as an invader <!-- ** -->
12:19 One can develop a food sensitivity if there's not enough variety and rotation in the diet <!-- ** -->
14:33 Leaky gut is when larger protein molecules from our food as well as bacteria and viruses in our gut leak into our circulatory system
15:33 Indigenous cultures or people who are living more traditional lives and diets don't have allergies, asthma, autoimmune disease, sinus problems, or eczema
19:36 We take out corn, soy, wheat, gluten, dairy, etc
20:18 Polyphenols protect and heal the lining of the gut

14 Belly fat causes inflammation, it is immunologically active, it produces adipose cytokines
15 These fat cells in your belly are super inflammatory, then you get inflammation which leads to oxidative stress

7:34 We can have HPA access over activity or under-activity
8:01 At the beginning acute stress and cortisol is helpful
9:10 Chronic stress over time can disrupt our hormone system
10:38 Over time with high levels of cortisol people start to crash, they have burnout

1:27 Five to ten percent of all women in the United States are impacted by PCOS
2:26 Symptoms are irregular periods, not having a period for some months, heavy periods
2:39 Other symptoms are Hirsutism which is the growth of hair where women don't want to have it, on their lip, chin, abdomen, belly
and then they're they may have hair loss where they want to have hair
3:15 It is because of high levels of male hormones like DHEA and testosterone that end up causing this male appearance
4:11 Additional symptoms can be acne, in the lower jaw, cystic acne, weight gain
4:58 With PCOS typically there is high levels of insulin
5:27 High insulin will cause people to gain weight around the belly
5:59 It's called polycystic ovarian syndrome which makes people think it's a gynecological problem but it's actually a dietary problem
6:12 It's not always dietary; it could be caused by toxins from the environment like BPA and plastics
6:38 Microbiome imbalances can also cause insulin resistance and pre-diabetes
7:36 You may have 10 women in a room with PCOS and you may have 10 different reasons for why they have PCOS
8:22 Conventional physicians prescribe birth control pills to regulate the cycle, metformin to improve insulin sensitivity, 
8:45 Conventional physicians prescribe Spironolactone, a diuretic that blocks the conversion of testosterone to the kind that causes hair loss
9:30 Diet is huge, too many processed carbs, for some people with certain genetics
13:50 There is a real connection between toxins in the environment and our metabolism, and then they get diabetes 
14:11 A person exposed to toxins only had to gain fewer pounds to get type 2 diabetes, where a typical person was gaining more pounds before they got type 2 diabetes
14:41 BPA in plastic has been well studied to show there's a connection with insulin resistance and weight gain
14:50 We've known for a long time about the connection between breast cancer and BPA
18:01 Microbiome bacterial lipopolysaccharides can cause insulin resistance
17:21 Your hormones are connected to your gut microbiome
18:13 This is called metabolic endotoxemia, it creates an inflammatory response which then affects insulin sensitivity
19:45 Start with a detailed patient history
22:05 Dr. Bohams case study, a 20-year-old woman
23:17 Dairy can cause a lot of congestion
23:47 I checked her antibodies against different components of her digestive system including lipopolysaccharides
24:04 Lipopolysaccharides are bacterial toxins that can trigger insulin resistance

17:42 When you go through menopause you urinate out your bones which store lead

&emsp; &emsp; Vague fatigue

&emsp; &emsp; GGT > 30
&emsp; &emsp; Fasting glucose > 90
12:48 Beware of patients taking too many supplements which can cause liver damage
13:26 Of those who report to emergency departments with acute liver damage, 20% of the time it's caused by large numbers of supplements
15:27 Fatty liver is that the triglycerides have physically crowded out the space for glycogen
18:09 A healthy diet for fatty liver should include some amount of all the macronutrients
18:58 There are many people with healthy BMI scores, their body weight is fine, but they still have metabolic issues like fatty liver or diabetes
19:40 Imaging of body composition showed their body weight is fine, but their body fat content is not
21:21 Imaging of body composition shows that fatty liver disease and these metabolic issues correlate with total body fat
21:37 Waist circumference is a predictor of fatty liver
22:04 10-40% of NAFLD will progress to NASH (inflammation)
24:08 The fatty liver index calculation can predict fatty liver
25:25 If suspicious of NAFLD then get an ultrasound
25:40 The ultrasound can detect 30% fibrosis, but it does not rule out milder disease
25:49 A normal ultrasound can not rule out fatty liver disease, so it is reasonable to proceed with lifestyle recommendations
26:52 You could have someone that's quite a ways in the NAFLD continuum, even if their ALT score is just high normal.
27:11 Low levels of micronutrients can drive NAFLD
27:26 Malabsorbing nutrients can be a part of this
28:17 Deficient healthy sources of glucose can contribute to NAFLD
<!-- 28:36 And for many that can have methylation defects, folic acid can inhibit the positive effects of folate in terms of natural folates and supplementation -->
29:27 Those on higher-fat diets are more apt to be lower in DHA
<!-- Silybum -->
30:42 Anything we do that's not addressing the fuel overload may not have lasting desired effects
30:50 Vitamin E has the most amount of positive outcomes
<!-- ursodiol, NAC, Ganoderma, reishi -->
33:19 There is strong evidence on the benefits of exercise.
35:05 A simple caloric deficit alone, just eating less, could be counterproductive
36:37 There's no harm from fruit
<!-- 36:54 dietary cholesterol is a driver -->
<!-- do eat carbs -->
<!-- 38:55 protein-sparing -->
39:38 Caloric deficit will benefit liver function
<!-- 39:44 This is the last book I put out. And in this, I talked about a way you can do a liver-supportive, protein-sparing modified fast. -->
40:41 Waist loss is more important than weight loss
<!-- 41:32 Any kind of fuel, once you're above your fuel balance, is harmful -->
43:45 With protein restriction there are some possible pitfalls in lacking in conjugating amino acids
<!-- 44:46 So there are three levels of data. There are mechanistic models, epidemiologic data, and interventional data. -->
45:25 Medications can cause nutrient depletion so give micronutrient support to prevent micronutrient deficiency
<!-- depleted glycogen is a problem -->
46:27 NAFLD in kids comes from fuel overload, obesogens, disruptors of circadian rhythm, and HPA axis
47:06 Chronic liver inflammation can skew ferritin and leave more ferritin in circulation
<!-- 48:21 Q "from a cooled rice, but if you reheat it, "do you lose that?" Actually, no. (laughs) So you cook and cool. Potatoes are the big winners for this. -->
49:34 Consume a gram of protein per pound of lean body mass.  Consuming less causes the body to have a harder time with conjugating compounds
<!-- 50:37 does want to avoid phase one inducers, and then maintain good amounts of healthy conjugation. -->
<!-- 50:55 I've seen a lot of data arguing now that HDL levels that high do correlate with substantial cardiovascular risk, especially for women. -->
51:44 So if someone is lacking in protein and they add collagen to their diet, they're not improving their protein status, they may be worsening it.
53:35 The liver can regenerate and heal just by targeting weight loss from the liver tissue
53:51 If cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) then minimize bolus fat intake, have fat well emulsified in foods, and spread out throughout the day.
<!-- 54:26 isocaloric diet and protein sparing is the best diet -->

1:24 Fewer than 3% of the US population is meeting the four basic points that predict that low risk
1:32 The four basic points are not smoking, 150 minutes of exercise a week, eating in the top two quintiles of a whole foods diet, and having a healthy body fat percentage
2:30 The New England Journal of Medicine review paper showed that cardiovascular disease is an inflammatory process, not just about cholesterol
3:43 In America chronic stress, loneliness, isolation, and bad sleep are huge factors in heart disease
10:27 Get the advanced cholesterol test which is Labcorp NMR or Quest Diagnostics CardioIQ
10:50 Heart disease is really a metabolic issue
11:39 Women in their 70s, thin, fit, exercise, eat well, don't smoke, have normal blood pressure, no diabetes, cholesterol 300, HDL 100, LDL 150, no small particles, do not need a statin
13:43 88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy
13:58 Fewer than one-third of so-called normal-weight people are metabolically healthy 
15:16 90% of Americans have some degree of pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes
15:33 Diabetes is a 100% reversible, preventable and treatable condition
17:02 Test the patient's insulin with a glucose and insulin challenge test because insulin goes up before glucose goes up
19:44 I had a patient with a glucose of 80, postprandial glucose was 110, and A1C was perfect.
19:59 Insulin normally should be under 5 fasting, and under 25 to 30 after a glucose drink
20:04 This patient's insulin was 50 fasting, and 250 after a glucose drink, so her body was pumping out high amounts of insulin
20:26 This patient lost 50 pounds when she cut out starch and sugar
20:33 If one does a glucose tolerance test without insulin on a hyperinsulinemic patient you will miss that patient's real problem
20:47 The high insulin is associated with small dense LDL and low HDL
21:10 Heart disease is really a hormonal issue related to insulin, insulin resistance, and inflammation
21:26 High blood pressure, cholesterol issues, and diabetes are seen as separate but they're manifestations of the same underlying biology
22:40 There are microbial signatures that strongly predict insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease
23:19 Low microbiome diversity, loss of butyrate, and loss of Akkermansia muciniphila correlate with loss of integrity of the gut lining
24:39 Encourage people to eat a diverse array of plant-based colorful plant-based foods
24:42 Consume polyphenolic foods for Akkermansia such as deeply pigmented berries, greens, garlic, onions, cranberries, etc
25:01 A company Pendulum recently created a probiotic named Glucose Control that reduces A1C -->
<!--25:19 I had a patient with diabetes go on a keto diet and the glucose improved from 250 to 120-130 which is better but not where I wanted it -->
<!--26 charcoal relieved bloating and normalized blood sugar
26:41 Pollution and particulate matter in urban areas have a huge correlation with heart disease
27:13 Studies show arteries lose elasticity when people are in urban environments with high air pollution counts
28:19 The American Journal of Cardiology showed if your lead level is over two then the risk of having a heart attack or stroke was greater than if your cholesterol was abnormal
29:29 Heart disease could be from the microbiome, nutritional deficiencies, environmental toxins, stress, lack of sleep
29:54 Two-thirds of people who are cardio metabolically unhealthy actually have sleep apnea
30:10 Dr. Hyman had a patient who was 50 pounds overweight.  A sleep study showed he had sleep apnea.
30:44 The patient used a CPAP machine, he lost 50 pounds, reversed his pre-diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure
<!--33:06 Dr. Geyer's patient, Dexa scan, vo2 max, gluten sens, low thyroid? -->
36:04 A low thyroid can increase cholesterol and definitely increase the risk of heart disease
36:55 Vitamin D deficiency plays a role in inflammation, metabolism, insulin resistance, and thyroid function 
<!--Lp-PLA, oxidized LDL -->
<!--38:23 we look at uh whether there's good cholesterol absorption or increased absorption or more production liver so are you, absorber producer of cholesterol -->
38:44 Look at the patient's heart rate variability
40:12 A study found an avocado a day, a high-fat food, lowered LDL cholesterol 20 points
<!--olive oil is good -->
40:48 Emphasize fats from fish, nuts, seeds, avocado, extra virgin olive oil
41:21 Virta Health uses a ketogenic diet of 70% fat, reverses diabetes in 60% of their patients, and has 12% weight loss
42:17 When we were hunters-gatherers we had to be able to pivot to whatever food sources were available to us 
43:09 The three things that have the best data for restoring metabolic flexibility are polyphenols, fasting, and exercise
